## 🌟 Projects  

### 🔹 APB Peripheral (UART & GPIO) Verification 
**Tools & Languages:** SystemVerilog, UVM, Synopsys VCS, Synopsys Verdi     
•	Developed a UVM-based self-checking testbench for APB-based UART and GPIO peripherals, including drivers, monitors, and scoreboards.
•	Implemented functional coverage and SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) to validate APB protocol compliance and data integrity.
•	Debugged RTL/testbench mismatches and optimized regression runs using Synopsys Verdi and scripting.

---

### 🔹 AXI4 Interconnect Verification 
**Tools & Languages:** SystemVerilog, UVM, Synopsys VCS, Synopsys Verdi
•	Built a UVM verification environment for AXI4 interconnect, supporting burst, split, and misaligned transfers.
•	Wrote constrained-random testcases and assertions to validate handshake, protocol timing, and data integrity.
•	Achieved functional coverage closure (>95%) and debugged corner-case failures using Verdi waveform analysis.
