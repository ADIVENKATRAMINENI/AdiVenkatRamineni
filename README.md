## 🌟 Projects  

🔹 **Functional Verification of SoC Interconnect** – UVM-based verification environment with drivers, monitors, and scoreboards. Validated multi-IP communication with constrained-random testing and coverage.  

🔹 **ASIC Data Path Verification** – Verified datapath operations using SystemVerilog testbenches, assertions, and random/directed testing. Improved efficiency of verification cycles.  

🔹 **I2C Multi-Bus Functional Verification** – Developed a layered UVM testbench including generator, driver, monitor, predictor, and scoreboard. Achieved high code and functional coverage with assertions.  

🔹 **Logic Design & Synthesis of Single-Stage Neural Network** – Designed optimized RTL for a binary CNN stage, synthesized using Synopsys Design Vision, verified timing with ModelSim.
