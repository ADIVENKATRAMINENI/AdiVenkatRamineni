## üåü Projects  

üîπ Advanced Verification of LC3 Processor

Tools & Languages: SystemVerilog, UVM, UVMF, QuestaSim

Built a UVM-based testbench for decode and write-back stages of the LC3 microcontroller using UVMF code generator.

Collaborated with a team of 5 to integrate 7 functional blocks at SoC level for full-system verification.

Implemented functional coverage models at both core and unit levels to validate pipeline execution.

üîπ AHB Interconnect UVC Development (Personal Project)

Tools & Languages: SystemVerilog, UVM

Developed an AHB5 Universal Verification Component (UVC) supporting multiple masters and slaves.

Implemented scoreboard, coverage, and assertion classes, improving bug detection and reducing debug time by 35%.

Streamlined testing by creating reusable sequence libraries and configurable UVM components.

üîπ Quantum Computer RTL Design

Tools & Languages: Verilog, Synopsys Design Compiler, ModelSim

Designed RTL for a quantum computer model with variable qubits, optimized for area, timing, and performance.

Applied parallelized computation to minimize latency and validated timing closure with Synopsys Design Compiler.

Verified functionality through simulation and synthesis, ensuring reliable matrix multiplication with complex numbers.

üîπ Functional Verification of I2CMB Controller

Tools & Languages: SystemVerilog, UVM, QuestaSim

Built a layered UVM testbench including generator, agent, driver, monitor, predictor, and scoreboard for I2CMB.

Applied constrained-random + directed tests with covergroups, cross-coverage, and assertions to validate corner cases.

Achieved 100% functional coverage and ~96% code coverage, ensuring robust protocol compliance.
